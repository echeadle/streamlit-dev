Paper Quality & GSM

Choosing the right paper depends on the writing instruments you use. At Note & Nib Co., we ensure high-quality paper across our ScribePad Notebooks, GiftSwirl & PaperCharm Wrapping Paper, and ChronoCraft Calendars.

- GSM (Grams per Square Meter) Explained
    - 70-80 GSM – Lightweight, good for casual note-taking.
    - 90-100 GSM – Ideal for smooth fountain pen writing, minimal ink bleed.
    - 120+ GSM – Premium, thick paper for professional use.

For fountain pens, we recommend 90+ GSM to prevent feathering and bleed-through.
