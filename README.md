### Chapter 3

## The Six Stage Development Flow

1. **State the concept:** To solve a problem—or to describe it to others—you
   first need to be able to state it succinctly at a high level.

2. **Define the requirements:** This is where you refine your concept and
   break it down into cold, hard requirements. Part of this is to define the
   scope of what your app will do and—perhaps more importantly—what it
   won't do.

3. **Visualize the user experience:** Draw diagrams and mocks of your
   envisioned user's experience when they use your app.

4. **Brainstorm implementation:** What components will your solution have,
   how will they integrate, and what tradeoffs do you face?

5. **Write code:** Actually implement your app.

6. **Iterate:** Inspect your output and refine steps 1 through 5 as necessary.
